        <p>Using a wooden spoon, or (even better) a food mixer, beat together the <b>butter</b> and <b>sugars</b> until just combined. Add the <b>vanilla extract</b>, then the <b>egg</b>, and beat in well.</p>
        <p>Sift together the <b>flour</b> and <b>bicarbonate of soda</b>, then use a spoon to add to the mixture, stirring until it just comes together into a dough. Fold in the <b>chocolate pieces</b>, then chill overnight, or for up to 72 hours.</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 180C. Line two baking trays with greaseproof paper, and divide the mixture into golf-ball sized rounds, spacing them well apart. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden, but not browned.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle lightly with <b>sea salt</b> if using, and allow to cool on the tray for a couple of minutes, before moving to a wire rack to cool completely â€“ or scoffing immediately.</p>
